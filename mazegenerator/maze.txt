Create a html css js website. Seperate those files. body margin and paddle is 0. There should be a container which is 80% height and 80% width. The container's name is maze. Maze should be in the middle of the screen, horizontally and vertically. Under maze there should be another container called controlpanel which is 10% height and 80% width. controlpanel should be in the middle of the x-axis. Inside control panel, there should be a horizontal slider which is 70% wide and a text input and submit button both 10% wide, side by side. the slider should range from 1 to 100. call the value squarenum. The text input should also be able to directly set the value of squarenum. When the value is set by the text input, update the slider as well. Inside maze, there should be squarenum (horizontally) times squarenum*0.526 round to the nearest int (vertally) amount of squares, each with white background and 10% black border. the square's margin and padding are all 0. Also change the height and width of the squares so that is always fit inside of the maze. More precicely, set the width to (100/squarenum)% and height to (100/squarenum*0.526 round to nearest int)%
switch the amount and the size of horzontal and vertical squares
lets change the rules of the maze a bit. inslide the container maze, there should be serveral small containers called rows. all rows should have 0 margin and 0 paddle with 100% width and display flex. the number of rows should be Math.round(squareNum * 0.52625). the height of each row should be 100/Math.round(squareNum * 0.52625) %. in each row, there should be squarenum amount of squares. each square should have {99/squareNum}% width and height.
