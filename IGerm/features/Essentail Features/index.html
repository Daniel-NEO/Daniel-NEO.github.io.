      <h2>Long Essays</h2>
      <p>Type as much words as you like!<br>5. Describe the most significant challenge you've faced and the steps you
        have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?<br>

        Everyone faces challenges once in a while. Some challenges are easier than others, but there is always that one
        challenge that you remember the most. The most significant challenge I’ve ever faced is when I was tasked to
        host an event when I was in 10th grade. During that time, I joined a club called “Interact Club” and got the
        position of Activity Leader. My main task is to host activities during class time. I am the kind of person that
        would put my 100% in when I am doing something that is related to others, and hosting an event is all about
        keeping others entertained. Most of the time, when I was tasked with hosting an event, some simple activity plan
        would pop into my head, and I would start preparing right away. However, one time an activity that would take a
        lot of time to prepare came to my mind, and I started on the project, despite knowing that it would be very time
        consuming.When I start on something, but have a better idea midway, I would start all over again, since this
        would mean the participants will feel happier. I spent hours, days, multiple nights working till 3 a.m., to
        finish the preparation. My parents would try to stop me, but my dedication for the happiness of others had
        overthrown my laws to obey my parents. I ended up with a custom made trivia with about 50 True or False
        questions, listed from easy to difficult, separated into three sections, and a couple of extremely tricky
        tiebreakers. The event turned out really well, and everyone had a lot of fun. All of the effort was worth it,
        for me. My parents and the club instructor were extremely concerned about my health. They reminded me that there
        are other leaders in Interact Club, and I am free to ask them for help anytime. My work could have been so much
        easier if I simply asked for help. My whole concept of achieving a mission had completely changed since then.
