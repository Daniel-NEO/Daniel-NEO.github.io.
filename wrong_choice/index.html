<!-- Is this not enough for you? Curiosity kills the cat. Trust me, you are the cat. -->
Knowledge is power, and that same power will devour your mind<br>
<br>
So, the reason why I am ignoring you<br>
is because I am selfish<br>
<!-- why am I doing this -->
<br>
You know, everytime I saw you talking to someone else<br>
(I think we both knew who that thing is)<br>
<!-- There're two people actually, but he is so much worse than her -->
I just gets envy<br>
It deeply hurts me, stabbed into my heart<br>
<!-- 這就是吃醋的感覺嗎? -->
physically<br>
My chest starts to burn and it is painful physically<br>
<!-- So many times I considered killing myself to escape the pain -->
<br>
And that's why I decided to stop talking to you<br>
To make me forget you<br>
To make my heart stop tearing itself apart when I realized you're having fun with others<br>
To let go of you<br>
I can't just stop liking you without ignoring you<br>
That's just not possible<br>
I can't stop my feeling towards you when I talk to you<br>
The only solution is to prevent myself from talking to you<br>
Prevent myself from liking you<br>
<!-- I still like you, but if I want to prevent myself from dying, I must ignore you -->
<br>
No I am not telling you to stop having any other friends, that would be overcontrolling you<br>
It is my fault that I don't know how relationship works<br>
and how to let go<br>
It is good that you are making more friends, someone who can make you smile, who can make you laugh, who can make you happy<br>
That is a good thing<br>
I still hope that you can be happy, even if I am not the one making this happen<br>
<!-- It might be painful, but this is for the bese -->
I still wish you for the best<br>
I simpily cannot continue liking you<br>
<br>
You don't need to worry about me<br>
I promised you that things won't go south<br>
I would still live a normal life, with or without a goal<br>
<!-- I have no more dream in my life, and I don't know what to do anymore. However, I can still become the working machine that my parents wants me to be -->
I'm sorry for being selfish, making you loose a friend just because of my personal reason<br>
But I think I need to be selfish sometimes.<br>
If you really wanted me to come back, you will need yo stop your contact with him<br>
And thats a really fucked up thing to ask you to do<br>
So I won't be coming back, talking to you as often as we do.<br>
Sorry<br>
<br>
That's all<br>
<!-- There's still more down there -->
Thankyou for showing up in my life<br>
Thankyou for giving me a reason to go to school<br>
Thankyou for giving me the motivations to improve<br>
Thankyou for giving me happiness while it lasted<br>
Thankyou.<br>
<br>
<!-- You know, I heard a story
Why loyal boys are always single?
Becuase loyal boy want permanent relationship
Because he also wants a loyal girl for the rest of his life
Becuase they always find themselves in the friend zone
Because he don't want to fuck up his entire future, so he ended up making no bold moves, express nothing, never reach out to her, fearing that she might think that he's weird and ended the relationship
He wishes her to be the best, to not take any harm from others, to make her happy in the future.
So he did everything he could to protect her, to help her, to do somthing for her to prevent future harm, to adjust her character so she can be more successful in the future
Telling her to plan for everything, to not stay up till 3am playing games, to prevent her from addiction
But thats why children hates their parents
They are overprotective
They account for their future, but they didn't account for their present
I think it is because one of the two reasons
One, they don't give a fuck about the future. All that matters now is that I am happy right this moment. I don't care that smoking will destroy my lungs, I am happy now and thats all I care
Two, they simpily don't realize the conciquence of the future, and they don't know the feeling of regret
Either way, parents will not be loved
Just like how loyal boys will not be loved
They love someone, they failed, and they never make the same fucking mistake again for the rest of their life
So thankyou for teaching me a lesson
I won't make the same mistake again. -->
